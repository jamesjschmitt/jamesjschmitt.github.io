            <h1 class="oswald-schmitt">Narrative Story</h1>
  
            <p class="nunito-schmitt">Here is a narrative piece, written as a news story.</p>
            <h1>______________________________________________________________________</h1>
  
            <h1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</h1>
    
            <p class="nunito-schmitt">In early 2021, the number of ICE detainees began to climb again.</p>

        <p class="nunito-schmitt">This increase followed a steep drop in 2020 when the pandemic forced immigration enforcement to scale back its operations. As border policies shifted and migration patterns changed, detention rates steadily rose, with the data showing a return to pre-pandemic levels by 2023. But there was something different about this recovery, something that was not immediately obvious from the surface numbers alone.</p>

        <p class="nunito-schmitt">Since 2019, Customs and Border Protection has steadily played a larger role in immigration detention. At times, it held more detainees than ICE. Data from the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse tracks detainee numbers by agency and shows that CBP outnumbered ICE at several points over the past few years. This shift often aligned with periods of increased migration at the U.S.-Mexico border.</p>

        <p class="nunito-schmitt">These numbers reveal more than just enforcement trends. They point to deeper questions about how immigration policies are applied and who they impact most.</p>
          
        <p class="nunito-schmitt">The dataset spans from 2019 to early 2025, capturing changes in both detainee counts and the way individuals are classified. It shows that the growing role of CBP in detention is not just a temporary change. Instead, it reflects a broader shift in how the country manages migration, with CBP taking on more responsibility as border encounters increased.</p>
          
        <p class="nunito-schmitt">By February 2025, the data recorded more than 43,000 individuals in detention. Of those, just over 21,000 were held by CBP. ICE, once the primary agency for immigration detention, held slightly fewer. Although the total number of detainees shifts from month to month, the reversal in agency roles marks a notable change in where immigration enforcement takes place. CBP, located at ports of entry and along the border, has increasingly managed detention during the early stages of processing, especially during spikes in migration from Central America and other regions.</p>
          
        <p class="nunito-schmitt">But looking at which agency is responsible only tells part of the story.</p>
          
        <p class="nunito-schmitt">The classification of detainees stands out just as clearly. Despite political messaging that often frames detention as a matter of public safety, most people held in these facilities are not convicted criminals. By early 2025, individuals categorized as other immigration violators, those without criminal records, made up more than half of the detainee population. Those with criminal convictions accounted for roughly a quarter.</p>
          
        <p class="nunito-schmitt">This pattern is not new. Even during the Trump administration, which expanded enforcement through executive orders, the data showed that the majority of detained individuals were held for immigration violations, not criminal conduct.</p>
          
        <p class="nunito-schmitt">Syracuse is far from the southern border, but these numbers still have meaning here. The city has long been seen as a place of welcome for refugees and migrants, with local organizations providing legal aid, advocacy, and community support. Even so, the effects of national policy shifts reach cities like Syracuse.</p>
          
        <p class="nunito-schmitt">Austin Kocher, an immigration researcher and geographer, said the ripple effects are likely to be felt across multiple industries in upstate New York. “Apple farming, fruit farming—certainly going to be affected,” he said, referring to sectors that depend on undocumented labor. He added that even industries like construction and restaurants, which employ both documented and undocumented workers, may face scrutiny under stricter enforcement.</p>
          
        <p class="nunito-schmitt">The rise in CBP detentions is one example. Border enforcement shapes the larger immigration system, even in communities hundreds of miles away. When more people are detained at the border, pressure builds across the system. Immigration courts face backlogs, legal aid organizations struggle to meet demand, and families are caught in the middle.</p>
          
        <p class="nunito-schmitt">Kocher also pointed to the potential role of law enforcement in shaping how immigration is handled locally. While immigration enforcement is technically under federal jurisdiction, local sheriffs—who are elected and often operate with political incentives—may choose to collaborate more closely with ICE or CBP. “They may find ways to try to hold people for Immigration and Customs Enforcement at the local jail,” he said, especially if cooperation offers political gains.</p>
          
        <p class="nunito-schmitt">This creates added complexity for regions like central New York. Syracuse is close to the Canadian border, and Border Patrol has been active in the region before. “They used to be fairly active at the train station and the bus station,” Kocher said, suggesting that residents—even far from the southern border—might still face contact with federal agents.</p>
          
        <p class="nunito-schmitt">The data also shows how detention remains a cornerstone of immigration policy. While the Biden administration pledged to focus enforcement on individuals with serious criminal records, detention continues to be widely used, even among those without criminal charges.</p>
          
        <p class="nunito-schmitt">In 2020, at the height of the pandemic, total detainee numbers dropped to around 19,000. This was one of the lowest points in recent history. But as conditions changed, the numbers climbed again, crossing 40,000 in several months over the past year.</p>
          
        <p class="nunito-schmitt">Policy changes like the end of Title 42, which allowed border officials to quickly expel migrants without standard asylum processing, reshaped how people were detained and processed. However, the basic approach of using detention as a primary tool of immigration control remains.</p>
          
        <p class="nunito-schmitt">This creates challenges for cities like Syracuse, which position themselves as sanctuaries. When detention rates rise and enforcement policies grow stricter, it can make it harder for local communities to support migrants. Families are placed in prolonged legal limbo, and the promise of safety feels harder to keep.</p>
          
        <p class="nunito-schmitt">For the people behind these numbers, the experience of detention can be life-altering, whether they are held in a CBP facility near the border or an ICE detention center farther inland. And for communities like Syracuse, the national trends are more than just data points. They shape the environment in which immigrants live, work, and hope to find stability.</p>
          
        <p class="nunito-schmitt">Kocher emphasized the need for more reporting that captures how local agencies view and implement immigration policy. “What does the sheriff think about immigration enforcement? What does the local police chief think?” he said. Without that insight, it becomes harder to understand how national trends play out at the community level.</p>
          
        <p class="nunito-schmitt">The data shows a system that continues to rely on detention, no matter how agency roles or political leadership may change. And behind every number is a person, with a story that reaches from the border to communities across the country.</p>
